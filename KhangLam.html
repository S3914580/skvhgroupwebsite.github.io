                I think when you look at my name you probably already guessed my nationality, and the answer is yes, I'm Vietnamese. 
                I was born and raised entirely in Ho Chi Minh City. 
                In my daily life activities, I will use Vietnamese because it is my mother tongue and everyone speaks Vietnamese. 
                But besides that, I still regularly use and improve English because it is a necessary language for me to use in my study and working environment.

            IT really has a lot of things that make me pay attention and feel interested in them. 
            But one of the things that makes me feel most excited about IT is the unlimited creativity, especially in software programming. 
            I feel that I am free to be creative, create new applications and software without too many constraints. 
            In addition, another thing that makes me pay attention to information technology is that it is always innovating and updating the most advanced technologies continuously. 
            Thereby, I see that IT will always be innovative and never out of date.

            After taking the MYERS-BRIGGS test, I got the ISFP or Adventure type result. ISFP is an introvert, easygoing, adventurous spirit who loves and experiences new things. I can understand the above results, in my daily life, I am often very spontaneous, imagining and thinking about the work I have done and imagining its results in many different ways. This helps me to be prepared in many situations. Besides that. ease and the spirit of discovering new things helps me handle projects in a way that is not stereotypical, through which I can find novel but effective solutions. However, I am considered to be quite competitive, competition is good to keep me motivated, but too fierce competition can lead to counterproductive effects.
            <br>
            Regarding the assessment of my learning outcomes, I have achieved Auditory 20%, Visual 50% and Tactile 30%, through which I am recognized as a Visual Learner. During the learning process, usually I will be able to learn and absorb the lectures very quickly if there are specific illustrations or videos. Moreover, like information about Visual Learner, I can absorb information very quickly through pictures or examples, so in the learning process, I will often try to follow the tutorials or Go to the internet to look up tutorials that aren't in the lesson.
            <br>
            For Openess to Experience, I'm rated Medium Characteristics. In the course of my work, usually I will be very interested and curious about new things. It is because these novelties can bring new ideas to me, helping me to create new moves in the projects that I participate in. In the opposite direction, sometimes in certain things I choose to do them according to a certain pattern. Therefore, if I can balance these two ways of working, I can do other tasks more efficiently.
