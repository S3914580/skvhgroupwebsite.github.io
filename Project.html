            Project Idea
        </h1>

        <h2>
            Overview
        </h2>

        <p>
            In recent years, in the context that the processor chips on mobile devices are becoming more powerful than ever, the development of applications on this platform is having great breakthroughs. Besides, the popularity of mobile devices is also increasing day by day, on the street we can easily realize that almost everyone owns a smartphone or tablet. Therefore, we believe that building and developing a project on this platform can bring a lot of potential for success. Our team's project is to develop an application that allows anyone to access a virtual world in the form of an immersive environment. Here, people will interact with each other and even trading, teaching, medical examination and treatment activities can also take place. Technologies like Block Chain or AI will also be applied to this virtual world.
        </p>


        <h2>
            Motivation
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            As everyone has seen, currently the Covid-19 pandemic is raging everywhere in the world. The whole world has suffered damage in all aspects, from daily life to economy, education, medicine are affected. In particular, people's psychology is the thing that is affected the most. Nearly everyone has had to go through social distancing or blockade to avoid the spread of the disease. During that time, although there are messaging apps, it will be difficult for people to avoid feelings of loneliness, confinement, and suffocation. That will have many serious consequences, and it is easy to see that society is gradually becoming more distant than ever. So the idea of a place where people can interact with each other like in real life, able to fully participate in activities as usual through an immersive environment came to mind in our group. This will be a solution to help people relieve some of the distance and loneliness not only during the current pandemic but also in future events.

        <h3>
            Feature 1: User interaction system
        </h3>

        <p>
            When everyone first joins, logging into the app will be taken to a virtual immersive environment where everyone can freely interact with each other. Everyone will control a character named by themselves to represent them. Users are completely free to design the shape and fashion style for their character, our system will provide all the necessary tools such as hair color, skin tone, clothing style. This is to ensure that everyone can express their personality and style as comfortably as they would in real life. Besides, when you first enter the application, there will be an AI to interact naturally with you, if you have any questions or confusion about the system and how it works, just chat with AI for answers, if beyond our understanding, AI will connect you directly with us to be able to answer. Regarding communication, we will apply today's modern chat technologies so that people can freely interact and connect with people they do not know but still ensure anonymity, learning will only see the nickname you have set. Things related to your account, personal information, all will be kept safe and only you can see and edit them. Besides, the application also has a chat and video call function so that people can interact with each other. To communicate, you just need to click on the contact window to be placed in a conspicuous view to select people. you want to contact and make a call or chat. Making a video call will completely let you connect to the webcam to record you. As this may reveal your true identity, the system will automatically send you an alert for your consideration. In addition, to be able to create the feeling of a normal living space, the system will set up a sound circle, if people stand in this circle, it is completely possible to interact and chat with you, If you go far away, you won't hear it anymore. This is to create realism while also minimizing the noise caused by too many people in the server.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Feature 2: Space for user interaction
        </h3>

        <p>
            When logging in and participating in the application, people will be taken to a space that is simulated in a specific and detailed way like our real-life living space. There will be servers that simulate different styles for users to choose from, from urban to rural areas, from eastern to western style places. The accompanying AI will also rely on your information to make appropriate suggestions in case you are confused. This virtual role-playing world will be built in 3D, participants can freely move, interact with utensils and buildings. This is an open world so we will also allow third parties to join as a rental partnership, they can choose to order a certain availability and build structures with almost All allowed items such as schools, shopping malls, hospitals or restaurants. The application will also facilitate connection with other services in real life to bring to this immersive world. Anyone can go to a school and listen to real-life lectures, anyone can order food delivery services, the system will link up with outside restaurants to help you make transactions. . For example, if you want to buy food in real life, you can absolutely go to this restaurant built in this immersive world to order, that restaurant will receive your information and deliver it to you in real life.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Feature 3: Transactions and payments
        </h3>

        <p>
            Our app can let you link your bank accounts to make transactions. However, the most prominent thing is that we will apply Blockchain to make payments easier for everyone. Because our application will be aimed at users all over the world, Blockchain-based payments can help everyone to ensure security and convenience. In addition, the application will also accept the use of Bitcoin to make payments. Another option is that people can buy their own currency in this immersive world to make purchases. The transaction manipulation process is very simple, when the user wants to buy something, a notification window will appear and announce the price, the user just needs to press the accept button and the application will automatically connect you to the banking system. Not only stopping at buying, users can completely sell or exchange these objects or things they own for others. Users can even sell and exchange in-app currency for real-life money.

        <h2>
            Tools and Technologies
        </h2>

        <p>
            To be able to build and develop this application, we will have to prepare a workstation with a strong enough performance. Computers with software should run on Windows 10 with 64-bit, or MacOS continuously updated to the latest versions (MacOS Big Sur or above). In terms of hardware, the machine should also have a large enough amount of RAM for the work to happen quickly and smoothly, since this is a rather large project, we need 32GB or 64GB. The capacity should be around 256GB, if needed, we can buy more removable drives. As for the programming tool, we will use Python as it is a popular programming software, we can easily get support from the community when we run into problems. In addition, we will also combine with MySQL to do the database array. For Windows machines we will be running Python using Pycharm and will be Xcode for MacOS.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Skill Required
        </h2>

        <p>
            To be able to build and develop this project, we will also need to have the necessary skills and knowledge. In terms of skills, things like commands, functions, features, and functions all need to be mastered. Particularly for this project, that programming software is Python, so the above skills combined with Python's unique features need to be mastered to a certain extent. For the database part, the skills of writing queries, creating and managing databases must definitely be mastered. In addition, we also have to learn and cultivate more knowledge about Block Chain and algorithms to be able to operate the trading system. Besides, we have to work in the same team so creativity and teamwork will also play a huge role in the success or failure of this project.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Outcome
        </h2>

        <p>
            This is indeed an ambitious project for us, because if the project is successfully developed, it will be one of the applications that is likely to actively support during our time. We can't see each other due to social distancing because of the epidemic or some other event. This will be one of the extremely good mental medicines for everyone. People can still talk or participate in events like in real life, it will reduce some of the loneliness in each person. In addition, this will also be a place where people around the world can meet and interact with each other, people can have cultural exchanges with each other without having to move too much. Thereby, we can convey to each other the most sincere messages without being prevented by any events.
