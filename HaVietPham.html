            Prior to joining RMIT, I was a student at Prior to joining RMIT, I was a student at  Swinburne in Melbourne, Australia. I finished the Diploma of Information  Technology and 1.5 year of the Bachelor of  Computer Science. But due to the pandemic  situation, I had to go back to Viet Nam and  postponed my studies in Australia. After a year of waiting to continue in Australia,  I decided to transfer to RMIT in Vietnam to  continue. Completed a GameDevHQ Unity course

        <p>    
            Despite having completed the Diploma of IT in Swinburne, IT is not my forte and I am not at all  interested in IT. I am more interested in Computer science that is in the making of games. 
            Even without any interest, I am able to understand the importance of IT in Game Development  and also what IT skills you can learn from Game Dev like: 
            ➢ Programming logic from making games, 
            ➢ Online tools and search engine used to research on the game or the process of making it, ➢ Files and Directories, Compile from exporting games from the engine, ➢ Flash memory, cloud storage and operating system compatibility from copying game files  from systems to systems, 
            ➢ Debugging and software revisions from responding to count less errors during the  development process.

            My result of an online Myers-Briggs test is ESTJ-A and I am considered as Executive Personality. ESTJ represents for an executive person type who is extraverted, observant, thinking and judging. Executives reflect tradition and order, drawing families and communities together by using their knowledge of what is good, improper, and socially acceptable. I am aware of my surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts; the certainty of their knowledge allows me to cling to my values and promote a clear view of what is and is not acceptable, even in the face of strong opposition. As ESTJs are extroverts, we get their energy from socializing and enjoy engaging in impassioned and vigorous debates. Furthermore, Executives are more than eager to delve into the most difficult projects, developing implementation plan and resolving details along the way, making even the most difficult jobs appear simple and attainable.

            Regards to learning test, I got 40% of auditory, 40% of visual and 20% tactile so I am an auditory and visual learner. I am more likely to learn efficiently by hearing and listening or visualisations. While information is delivered through both sound and speech, as well as visuals, graphics, colours, and maps, auditory/visual learners acquire greater knowledge or communicate ideas and concepts more effectively.  While mostly people have only one learning style, I have two learning style which are equal and make up the majority of the percentage and I also feel difficultly to perceive which one is more slightly dominant. Therefore, I consider both my photographic and echoic memory work well and I can achieve high efficiency in academic stuff if I have proper learning methods.

            As a moderately Openness person, I am approximately as likely as the average person to think abstractly and creatively. In terms of thinking, I'm neither very eccentric nor too conservative. I consider myself to be a sensible person who is open to new ideas. Thereby, I see myself as a person with a clear direction and decisiveness in most decisions. When faced with difficulties at work, people with higher Conscientiousness stat will tend to solve something with greater determination. My Openness stat shows that I am an open and modern person who approaches things in a modern way, absorbing new things positively. High scorers in Conscientiousness are well-organized and focused, and they can postpone instant satisfaction in favour of long-term success. High Extraversion portion is a personality trait that defines a person's need for stimulation from the outside world, particularly in the form of other people's attention. This means that I am particularly emotional about social or personal achievements that attract the attention of a crowd. I'm really good at dealing with crowds and that brings out my strengths.        </p>
