                I am Vietnamese and I was born in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I  completed eleventh grade in a high school in Vietnam and started studying abroad in Australia. I  had almost 2 years studying in Sydney and then came back to Ho Chi Minh city due to COVID 19 outbreak. 
                I love Maths, Computer and Technology so that I think IT would be a field that is  most appropriate for me. Outside of university, I have a strong passion on playing football and  taking care of my pet. 
                I have an extremely adorable but slightly naughty female cat. 
                It is quite  interesting that I like crowded and bustling activities, and because of that, my extrovert personality  is dominant. 
                I love person-to-person interaction, but perhaps the overwhelming number of people  involved makes me feel uncomfortable.

            My path to the IT industry is quite complicated. 
            At the age of 17, I did actually not know what my  passion is, which discipline is appropriate for me and which occupation I should do in the future.
            I did research on the most in demand professions in Vietnam and the world as well as took a deep  dive into every single profession that I thought I might love it.
            Furthermore, IT graduates would likely easy to find a permanent position in a company in the  modern era that technology is the leading field.
            In addition, graduate students who take an entry level position with a start-up or a huge tech business are likely to achieve massive development in  the short term.
            Besides, I am a big fan of Elon Musk whose business deals with technology, smart  cars, application and so on.
            He is extremely successful in the technology field and also famous because of his net worth which is highest in the world.
            Tesla and PayPal are two companies that use IT  applications to bring him huge profits every year.

            My result of an online Myers-Briggs test is ESTJ-A and I am considered as Executive Personality. ESTJ represents for an executive person type who is extraverted, observant, thinking and judging. Executives reflect tradition and order, drawing families and communities together by using their knowledge of what is good, improper, and socially acceptable. I am aware of my surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts; the certainty of their knowledge allows me to cling to my values and promote a clear view of what is and is not acceptable, even in the face of strong opposition. As ESTJs are extroverts, we get their energy from socializing and enjoy engaging in impassioned and vigorous debates. Furthermore, Executives are more than eager to delve into the most difficult projects, developing implementation plan and resolving details along the way, making even the most difficult jobs appear simple and attainable.

            Regards to learning test, I got 40% of auditory, 40% of visual and 20% tactile so I am an auditory and visual learner. I am more likely to learn efficiently by hearing and listening or visualisations. While information is delivered through both sound and speech, as well as visuals, graphics, colours, and maps, auditory/visual learners acquire greater knowledge or communicate ideas and concepts more effectively.  While mostly people have only one learning style, I have two learning style which are equal and make up the majority of the percentage and I also feel difficultly to perceive which one is more slightly dominant. Therefore, I consider both my photographic and echoic memory work well and I can achieve high efficiency in academic stuff if I have proper learning methods.

            As a moderately Openness person, I am approximately as likely as the average person to think abstractly and creatively. In terms of thinking, I'm neither very eccentric nor too conservative. I consider myself to be a sensible person who is open to new ideas. Thereby, I see myself as a person with a clear direction and decisiveness in most decisions. When faced with difficulties at work, people with higher Conscientiousness stat will tend to solve something with greater determination. My Openness stat shows that I am an open and modern person who approaches things in a modern way, absorbing new things positively. High scorers in Conscientiousness are well-organized and focused, and they can postpone instant satisfaction in favour of long-term success. High Extraversion portion is a personality trait that defines a person's need for stimulation from the outside world, particularly in the form of other people's attention. This means that I am particularly emotional about social or personal achievements that attract the attention of a crowd. I'm really good at dealing with crowds and that brings out my strengths.        </p>
