            Hello, as part of an assignment for an introductory subject in my IT degree, I have been asked to interview an IT professional in order to get some idea of the day-to-day work in the IT discipline. I would be very grateful if you could spare up to 30 minutes of your valuable time to speak with me/us about this. Your responses will be variable and material in our assignment report in the future. My name is Son and this is my first year and second semester at RMIT.
        </p>

        <p>
            My name is Vy, Bui Anh Vy. This is my first year and second semester, too. First, can you introduce yourself and which company you are working for?
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            Ok, my name is Huy, Le Nguyen Thanh Huy. I've been a programmer for 4 years now. During my work, I used to work through outsourcing and products for the company.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Son Vu
        </h2>

        <p>
            So, let’s go to the first question. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            As I mentioned above. At my current job, I am working at COTAI - Center of Talent in AI. In the morning I will do programming and projects for the company. In the company, I have another job that is tutoring. In the evening, I will teach if there is a class. In addition, I teach students at Le Hong Phong High School about Python and AI.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Vy Bui
        </h2>

        <p>
            Next, we go to the second question. Can tell us about the industry you work in.
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            Currently, in my opinion, when working in the programmer industry, there will be 3 areas of work. The first is outsourcing, making products for the company and finally giving extra tutoring on programming subjects. Therefore, I have a question: do you guys know what outsourcing is and what is a product in house?
        </p>

        <h2>
            Vy Bui
        </h2>

        <p>
            Oh sorry, I don’t know much about it. Can you talk more about it?
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            Outsourcing means that the customer will approach his company and place an order. Maybe the customer will already have ideas and details, I just need to follow. On the other hand, the client will have an idea but they need to listen to advice and need someone with expertise to come up with the idea for them. With planning, I will plan for them, then explain what my solution to their problem is. In the past, there was a time when I worked at FPT, FPT was an outsourcing company and here there were many types of customers. However, often when customers approach large companies, they already know what they want, so there are a few projects they will provide details and I just need to follow. My current company is COTAI with a smaller scale so sometimes I have to plan some projects for them because the client doesn't know it well. Because my company specializes in AI, they want to test whether their idea can be applied to AI or if the customer already has a system, how to apply AI to that system.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Son Vu
        </h2>

        <p>
            So, between those to IT work, which one you prefer more and why?
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            In my opinion, if you are a new graduate, outsourcing will be better because when you do outsource, you will have access to the details and designs of the customer. In a word, what classes and functions and variables will be in that software, etc. If you have already learned about ADI, what ADIs the system will include and what components will ADI have in it or how to call each other, the customer will provide enough about those parts. When you first get out of school, you will learn more when you approach those things. And if I join a start-up company that makes products, I have to take care of that product, that is in the case of small companies. When I make a product like that, I have to be more creative on my own. For example, in the past, I worked at a start-up company and there were only 3 programmers at that time, the 3 of us had to discuss with each other how to design the system because their superiors only worked in economics and marketing, they don't have IT expertise, so 3 people have to do everything by themselves. As I see it, when you do it yourself, it is possible that with a new graduate level that is not enough, it is easy to get lost and don't know if you are doing it right or wrong. Therefore, when you just graduated from school, you should do outsourcing at a big company, when you have enough experience, you should move to a small company so that you can master the technology you code.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Vy Bui
        </h2>

        <p>
            I know what you mean. This is really good advice for us. For the next question, can you tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            At work, I will have interactions with superiors such as team leader and project manager. Every morning in the company, there will be a sign-up meeting of about 5-10 minutes to report to your superiors about what you will do today and what you did yesterday to the team leader so that they can understand the progress. work level. When you become a team leader or have been working for a while, you will report directly to the person in charge of the project. If they choose to work at a smaller company, they will be able to interact directly with the board of directors about their ideas. For example, when I run a start-up, I get to pitch my ideas for improvements and features that user might like. At that time, you will be able to contribute to the requirements of that project, not just the code. Obviously, the latter will be more interesting because the children will be able to contribute their ideas to the product, rather than following someone else's request.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Son Vu
        </h2>

        <p>
            It is said that you have to try to interact with different people in your workplace as much as possible to gain more experiences and have more motivation in your work. So, do you think it is correct or something is not true?
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            Oh, actually in my daily work, interacting with colleagues will often happen when I have difficulty or something I don't understand. I can ask colleagues who work nearby or the team leader when they have free time. When we take the time to ask, it will help us improve our knowledge. If I say interact as much as possible, then I have to ask the question of what to interact because there's no way I'm just running around asking people, then other people will be annoyed and don't want to reply. So in my opinion, interacting with the team leader is the best.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Vy Bui
        </h2>

        <p>
            We can see lots of work you have to do in IT work so what aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            People often say "think first, code later". First, I will read a requirement file to get an idea. Brainstorming usually takes a lot of time. For example, if the boss wants to have an interface that requires different customizations, after I hear the idea, I will look at the design and then think if I want to do so, what class should I write and what are the properties inside that class. Also must determine how to design the API. In addition, I also have to pay attention to whether my current database can contain this information, or whether additional tables/columns are needed. If I read the requirements in the morning, then I don't start coding until noon or afternoon. When I think carefully, the code will be very fast. And again, when I receive a task from a manager or a client when they want to do something, I quickly think about whether my current system can do that. But it's not like I'll agree to everything they say and then when I check again and find I can't do it and report back, that won't be good.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Son Vu
        </h2>

        <p>
            I agree with you with what you share with us. As you said before we meet so many requirements during the time we work. Do you have any advice that you can suggest to us what we need to prepare in the time we’re studying in university?
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            I have a question back for you guys. Have you guys made any group coding products yet?
        </p>

        <h2>
            Son Vu
        </h2>

        <p>
            I and 3 other group members wrote code together and we had to make a plan and make a schedule and did it very soon to complete it before the deadline. We did everything together.
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            It is true that in school will teach you to plan, schedule, etc, in general, things related to management. When fresh out of school, the task will be more about coding. As I said when you read that requirement, in your mind you will need to think of what class and how to design. Therefore, to make these things simpler, students should focus on subjects such as data structures, algorithms, and databases. Besides, you can see more design pattern courses online. In my opinion, the above 3 things are the most important because during the interview, you will encounter a lot of questions about the above contents, partly because the above 3 contents are very important when working on a project. Talking a bit about the Design pattern, then the Design Pattern has 2 areas, the first is the folder tree in the project, I have to create a folder. For example, you will create a folder by function, this folder will contain everything related to management because in the system there is customer management, user management, product management in the website or product interaction management. On the other hand, the simplest one is an MVC pattern, which is the most basic design pattern. You can find out more on the internet. It will have classes like the user class, what information the product has, a view model and a controller. First, there will be classes and controllers - where the logic is handled - for example, if you want to create a new user in the system, the user will enter the information and password, the controller will only handle the logic, it will receive the username. Enter and password and check if this username exists or if the password is valid. Then we will create a user object and put the user object into a storage place like a database or excel. It will have 3 individual entries. If I say more, it may cause some confusion for you, so after this interview, you can read more online and you will see that the activities of these 3 are not related to each other. You can learn more about the design pattern with the most basic being the MVC pattern.

        <p>
            Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? It means you are best at this work.
        </p>

        <h2>

        <p>
            Once upon a time, I worked at a start-up called go 2 joy. What I do is about booking hotels like Traveloka or Agoda. When I started working on it, the project was in progress. Many people say that doing it is dry because sitting in front of the computer typing commands, but when doing it, it is much more fun. When doing so, they will have access to many other jobs like when I do, I know more about marketing: how to attract users when my app is just posted on the Appstore and how to create promotions. I learned how to make a complete project from the leader of that project. The most fun is when it's done and the product is in shape, then I see how other people use it and get feedback. When doing a big project, there will be tracing and monitoring, then I will open it to see how many users used my app yesterday or what district the users came from. Watching those things is also fun, like when I open the app at the weekend, I see other people using my app a lot. I'm so happy because I feel like it's my own child.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Son Vu
        </h2>

        <p>
            In that project, what type of users did you work in and what … of marketing that you used in that project?
        </p>

        <h2>
            IT Professional
        </h2>

        <p>
            The approach will be young people or those who want to book. First, he will hit an area with many hotels such as District 4 or District 7 to organize application launches. Besides, you have to think about how to limit a user from using multiple phone numbers to use too many vouchers. About promotion, at the beginning of the app, it is best to reduce the price by 40-50%.
        </p>

        </h2>

        <p>
            For him, coming up with ideas is a most time consuming. When his superior want him to create a software interface, he will spend most time to think about how design it and requirements before coding. If he reads requirement in the morning, he will start coding in the evening.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What aspect of their position is most challenging?
        </h2>

        <p>
            At work, sometimes he also encouters come difficulties such as finding and solving the problem for the requirement. Besides, when writing code, it is nescessary to optimize the code to increase execution speed and reduce the amount of hardware. For those who do not know or do not know or do not understand well, they must read descriptive documents in foreign languages. After giving a solution, you must present to explain the problem to colleagues. For customers, they have to creatively propose the best features or solutions for customers. Sometimes will be late because of too much work and not enough time to do.
